# NEYX 

## About Us
NEYX is on a mission to redefine the integration of traditional business with the blockchain universe. It transcends the conventional boundaries of blockchain oracles. Rather than focusing on high-frequency pricing data, we aim to unlock real value for Web2 users by leveraging their data within the Web3 ecosystem. We aim to open up blockchain's unique features to traditional businesses in a scalable and integrated manner. Our vision is to make oracles for Web3 what APIs are to Web2 - gateways that unlock immense opportunities and functionalities. Through our innovative approach, we enable businesses to not only transition into the blockchain space seamlessly but also to harness its full potential, creating value and enhancing efficiency in unprecedented ways.

## Our Projects
Our flagship project, NEYX, aims to revolutionize the certification process within the blockchain ecosystem, utilizing the $NEYXT token to create a sustainable and transparent environment. This initiative builds upon our team's previous work, incorporating lessons learned and successes from our contributions to CosmosJS and CosmWasm.

## Technology Stack
Cosmos SDK for its modular architecture, focusing on Go for its robustness and efficiency. Solidity for brindging to Ethereum through EVMOS. Traditional systems and IoT devices languages such as C, Python, JavaScript, and Java, ensuring broad applicability and impact.
