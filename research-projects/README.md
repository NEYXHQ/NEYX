# Research Projects Directory

Welcome to the `research-projects` directory! This space is dedicated to exploring, examining, and potentially integrating various blockchain and IoT technologies into our ecosystem. Here, we store forks and references to projects that inspire our development, offer innovative solutions, or present opportunities for future collaboration.

## Purpose

The goal of this directory is to:

- Serve as a repository for ongoing research and development efforts.
- Facilitate the exploration of new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies.
- Encourage team discussions and collaborations on promising projects.

## Projects

Each sub-directory within `research-projects` represents a project under consideration or analysis. These projects have been chosen for their potential to enhance our platform, contribute to our mission, or inspire innovation within our team.

## Contribution

We invite all team members to contribute to this research effort by adding new projects, updating existing ones with findings, or initiating discussions on potential integrations.

## Guidelines

- When adding a new project, create a new sub-directory and include a README with an overview of the project, its potential impact, and any relevant findings.
- Ensure proper attribution to original authors and respect all licensing agreements.
- Keep discussions constructive and focused on how the project could benefit or be integrated into our ecosystem.

Thank you for contributing to our research efforts and helping to shape the future of blockchain and Oracles!
